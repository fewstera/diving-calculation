> A set of tools for performing diving related calculations.

Diving calculations is a Javascript module for performing diving calculations. Most of the calculations are related to gas mixing, but there is plans to add other diving calculations.

## Ideal gases
Currently the gas calculations assume we are working with [ideal gases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ideal_gas), which are hypothetical gases that do not exist. This means when using the calculations in real life situations the results may not exactly match the fraction of gases you specify. There are plans to add real gas calculations.
